## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I have learned that it's important to use CSS reset so that the standardized browser layout will be set to 0/null/nil. This way I can take control of my styling, which was fun but it's a really tedious work... I love a good challenge though. 

### Continued development

I will be using flexbox and grid layouts in the future. I'm also thinking about using React, Vue and Angular in my future projects.
